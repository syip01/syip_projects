Library Simulator

Data Structures Final Project @ Quincy College

This program is designed to simulate people using a library borrowing books and returning them.  
Each day a reader would borrow a random non-duplicate number of books for the day and return them the following data.  
Some readers have a greater priority than others and will be dealt with first.  
Readers that do not get all their books will have their priority increased per day until they receive all of their books.  
The library has books that any person can obtain, however there may be limited copies for a particular book.

This program was written with VS2017 in C++.  
Elements implemented/required in the final project:  
Dynamic Array (Hashtable)  
Linked List (Priority Queue)  
Template Class (Hashtable, Priority Queue)  
Data Structures (Hashtable, Priority Queue, Stack)  
Containers (Vector, Stack)  
STL Algorithm (Shuffle)  
Searching (Hashtable - Quadratic Probing)  
Sorting (Priority Queue - Insertion)
