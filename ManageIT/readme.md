This is the new home of ManageIT with some revisions post-release.
The primary focus is to finish up elements such as more thorough JUnit testing and attempt to fix Bootstrap/template related issues.
Secondary objectives are to add functionality to the code that were not present like validation to the event classes
and the prevention of being able to attempt posting events when the Rooms and Groups are not populated.
